#![no_std]
//! Production Escrow contract.
//!
//! Investors crowdfund a farmer's production campaign. Funds are held in escrow,
//! released in tranches as production progresses, and distributed proportionally
//! to investors on settlement.
//!
//! Lifecycle:
//!   Funding -> Funded -> InProduction -> Harvested -> Settled
//!   Funding -> Failed (deadline passed without target)
//!   Funded | InProduction | Harvested -> Failed (mark_campaign_failed)
//!   any -> Disputed -> resolved (Settled / Failed)
//!
//! Failure recovery:
//!   - Failure before funding target (Funding): full refund of contributions.
//!   - Failure after funding but before production start (Funded): full refund.
//!   - Failure during production (InProduction): proportional refund from remaining
//!     escrow after tranche(s) released.
//!   - Failure after harvest (Harvested): proportional refund from remaining escrow
//!     plus any accrued revenue.
//!   - Shortfall: when tranche releases exceed available escrow for refunds,
//!     investors receive their proportional share of what remains. The farmer is
//!     not obligated to return released tranches — the loss is proportional.

// COST NOTE:
// Contribution tracking now uses indexed keys Contribution(campaign_id, investor_addr) instead
// of unbounded per-campaign Maps (Contributions(campaign_id) -> Map<Address, i128>). This reduces
// worst-case ledger entry size from O(n_investors) to O(1) per operation. A campaign with 1k
// investors no longer stores all contributions in a single ledger entry; instead, each
// invest/refund/claim is a separate O(1) operation. Batch refunds are capped at 50 investors
// per call to prevent ledger thrashing.
